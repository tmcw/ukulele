This ukulele tab is based off of the capo-3 version for acoustic guitar.

[F] Lover, now that you've [Am] left me, I'm glad you're [Dm] unlovely.

Becuase if you could [A#] take all the heat in your [F] heart and just hang it from [C] you,

[F] I wouldn't be able to [Am] bear the way you cannot [Dm] love me.

It's much [A#] easier of me [C] to make a monster out of [F] you.

[F] And so here I go, substi[Am]tuting the glow from your [Dm] temples,

all our sighs and our [A#] trembles, [F] and each last letter [C] sent you

from the [F] cheap little pen of this [Am] weak little man

- the one [Dm] singing - out his jangling, [A#] ringing and hopefully [C] stinging attack upon [F] you.

[F] Yeah, so here I go, just [Am] exploding the hope we'll be [Dm] speaking

some day, years from now, [A#] seeking [F] friendship and [C] understanding.

Yeah, I [F] hope you get angry, and [Am] hurt, and have the hardest of [Dm] landings.

And i hope your new [A#] man thinks of me when he [C] sees what a number I did on [F] you.

[F] I grow tired of this song. Turn my [Am] eyes to the blonde in the [Dm] bleachers.

She's a lovely young [A#] creature. I [F] think she's seeking [C] adventure.

I [F] think she's ready to [Am] see that the world isn't so sweet or so [Dm] tender.

I won't break her, just [A#] bend her, and make her into my [C] new ringer for [F] you.

I stay in the [F] same comfy town, write the [Am] same old songs down, drive the [Dm] same streets,

seek the same sense of [A#] dull peace, [F] whisper the same sweet words to the [C] chippies.

The same [F] walk by the road and where the [Am] same muddy snow's finally [Dm] leaving,

But I'll fight off the [A#] spring; I don't want lovely [C] things, I don't want the earth new. [F]
