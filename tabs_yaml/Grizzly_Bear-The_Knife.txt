_The Knife_ was released on Yellow House by Grizzly Bear and as a single. The first half seems to 
be in the key of F#, and then the song transitions to the key of E after the instrumental break. You can check out the 
"original on YouTube":http://youtube.com/watch?v=xuYZbYtAl9A - along with one trippy music video.

I want you to know [B]

When I look in your eyes [G#m]

With every blow [B]

Comes another lie [G#m]

You think it's all [C#] right

You think it's all [B] right

You think it's all [C#] right

You think it's all [B] right
