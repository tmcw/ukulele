This tab is, like some others, under development. It's pretty complete 
at this point, though you should look at the 
"original":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfptieWXEJA to get the semi-tricky rhythm parts. I've played this one live - the chord arrangement goes pretty well with a solo uke + voice.

When I (riff) watch you, wanna do you, right where you're [A] 
standing... [E] yeah.

Right on the (riff) foyer, on this dark day, right in plain [A] 
view...oh, [E] yeah....

Of the whole (riff) ghetto, the boot-stomped meadows, but we ignore [A] 
that, [E] yeah.

You're lovely (riff) baby, this war is crazy, I won't let you [A] 
down...oh, [E] no no....

(chorus riff)

No, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you...Hell, no no...

Oh, no...I won't let them take you, won't let them take you...Hell, no 
no...

No, oh no, no, no....

And when our (riff) city vast and shitty falls to the [A] Axis, [E] 
yeah...

They'll search the (riff) buildings, collect gold fillings, wallets, and 
[A] rings...oh, [E] yeah.

But Miss Black (riff) Eyeliner, you'd look finer with each day in  [A] 
hiding, oh [E] yeah...

Beneath the (riff) wormwood, ooooo, love me so [A] good...

They won't hear us screw away the day.

I'll make you say:

.Alive! Alive! Alive with love, alive with love tonight....

.Alive! Alive! Alive with love, alive with love tonight....

(No, I won't let them take you, won't let them take you...Hell, no no...

Whoa, no...I won't let them take you, won't let them take you...Hell, no 
no...)

Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love....

Treblinka, alive with the glory of love! Yeah!

(Ok, speed it up....Go!)

Should they (riff) catch us and dispatch us to those separate work [A] camps. [E]

I'll dream (riff) about you, I will not doubt you with the passing of [A] time....Oh, [E] yeah.

Should they (riff) kill me, your love will fill me as warm as the [A] bullets, [E] yeah.

I'll know my (riff) purpose: this war was worth this. I won't let you [A] down... [E]

No, I won.t....

No, I won.t....

No, I won.t....

(Alive! Alive! Alive with love, alive with love tonight...)

Hell no, no...Whoa, no, I won't let them take you, won't let them take 
you....Hell, no, no.

No! No!
