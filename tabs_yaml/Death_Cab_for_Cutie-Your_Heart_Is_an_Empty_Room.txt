h3. Verse 1

[C] Burn it [Em] down till the [Am] embers smoke [Em]on the [Fmaj7] ground 

[C] And start [Em] new when your [Am] heart is an [Em] empty [Fmaj7] room 

With [Am] walls of the [Em] deepest [Fmaj7] blue 

[C] Home's [Em] face: how it [Am] ages when [Em] you're [Fmaj7] away 

[C] Spring [Em] blooms and you [Am] find the [Em] love that's [Fmaj7] true 

But you [Am] don't know what [Em] now to [Fmaj7] do 

Cause the [Am] chase is [Em]  all you [Fmaj7] know

And she [Am] stopped running [Em]  months [Fmaj7] ago


h3. Chorus:

[C] And [Fmaj7] all you see [C] is [Fmaj7] where else you could [Am] be when [Em] you're at [Fmaj7] home

[C] Out [Fmaj7] on the street [C] are so [Fmaj7] many possibil[Am]ities to [Em] not be [Fmaj7] alone


h3. Verse 2:

[C] The flames and [Em] smoke [Am] climbed out of [Em]  every [Fmaj7]  window 

[C] And disap[Em]peared with [Am] everything that [Em] you held [Fmaj7] dear

And you [Am]  shed not a [Em] single [Fmaj7] tear

for the [Am] things that you [Em] didn't [Fmaj7] need

Cause you [Am] knew you were [Em] finally [Fmaj7] free
