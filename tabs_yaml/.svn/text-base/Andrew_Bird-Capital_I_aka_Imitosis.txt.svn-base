Andrew Bird's Capital I is one of my favorite songs of all time. 
Originally called just "I":http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird/_/I on Weather Systems, it was called "Capital I" in the space between that album, 
during the Mysterious Production of Eggs period, and until _Armchairs_, when, due to copyright squabbles, it was retitled Imitosis and given 
a latin feel. To see the best version, check out "Fabchannel's concert video":http://fabchannel.com/andrew_bird_concert

The general chord progression is [Am] to [C] to [G7], occasionally using the version of Am with a C on the high A string.
