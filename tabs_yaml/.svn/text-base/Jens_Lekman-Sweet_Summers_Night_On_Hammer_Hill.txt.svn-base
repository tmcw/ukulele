[Gm] Oh!, I still remember [C] 'Regulate' with (riff) Warren G

[Gm] could I be back in the [C] sweet summer of [0010] 199-[A#]-3

it was a [Gm] sweet summers [C] night on Hammer [F] Hill

[Gm] Oh! The sound of distant [C] cannibal drums [0010]
           
the Spanish [A#] guitar someone strums


it's a [Gm] sweet summers [C] night on Hammer [F] Hill.

My heart goes like...

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom....

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom...

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?
C

Bom, bom, bom,bom, bom...


[Gm] Oh! The memories, they come a-streaming

When I`m walking round here dreaming

it`s a sweet summers night on Hammer Hill

Oh! The memories, they come a-streaming

When I`m walking round here dreaming

it`s a sweet summers night on Hammer Hill

My heart goes like...

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom....

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom...

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?

(Normal verse chords)
Oh no!, Oh no!, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh no!, Oh no!, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh no!, Oh no!, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh no, no, no Is coming back to me

Oh no!, Oh no!, Is coming back to me

Oh no!, Oh no!, Is coming back to me

It`s a sweet summers night on Hammer Hill

My heart goes like...

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom....

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?

[C] Bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, [C] bom, bom...

[F] Can you hear the [A#] beat of my heart?
